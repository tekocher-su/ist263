        My name is Theo Kocher and I am an industrial and interaction design major. 
I’ve always loved to build functional art which is basically entirely what industrial design is. I think that made it the perfect fit for me. Through the program I’ve gotten professionally certified in a CAD software called solidworks, and learned to use photoshop, illustrator, and the whole adobe app suite. When I’m not working on my design projects, I enjoy bringing my camera out into nature and taking photos. I’m from Philadelphia and am a big baseball fan so I try to watch as many Phillies games as I can each year. I’m very excited to start learning how to make websites because I think it can help me a lot in both my professional and personal life.
