        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
       <p>My name is Theo Kocher and I am an <strong>industrial and interaction design</strong> major. 
        I've always loved to build functional art which is basically entirely what industrial design is. I think that made it the perfect fit for me. Through the program I've learned to use a number of professional softwares including:</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>a CAD program called Solidworks</li>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
            </ul>
        
         <p>When I'm not working on my design projects, I enjoy bringing my camera out into nature and taking photos. I'm from Philadelphia and am a big baseball fan so I try to watch as many Phillies games as I can each year. I'm very excited to start learning how to make websites because I think it can help me a lot in both my professional and personal life.</p>
