    <h2>About us: We are two industrial design students with a passion for illustration. We both discovered that we enjoy procrastinating our assignments by drawing weird, wacky, and sometimes wonderful things. In this shop you will find a collection of our favorite designs that we've decided to turn into shirts and stickers so you can adorn your laptop, water bottle, or even your body. We hope you enjoy these drawings as much as we do and decide to buy some so we can afford excessive amounts of coffee.</h2>
